The project is implemented as a semester work within the course B0B36PJV with the aim to deepen the knowledge of object-oriented programming and to get acquainted with the tools associated with it. The project includes writing documentation, mastering the graphical interface and as a result creating a game engine, on the basis of which a full-fledged game can be created in the future.

During the project, we used the criteria listed on the CourseWare page for the term paper. More information can be found [HERE](https://cw.fel.cvut.cz/b202/courses/b0b36pjv/semestral/herni_engine).
